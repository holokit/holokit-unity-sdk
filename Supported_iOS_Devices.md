## Supported iOS Devices

The following iPhone models are supported by HoloKit:

- iPhone XS / XS Max
- iPhone 11 Pro / 11 Pro Max
- iPhone 12 / 12 Pro / 12 Pro Max
- iPhone 13 / 13 Pro / 13 Pro Max
- iPhone 14 / 14 Plus / 14 Pro / 14 Pro Max
- iPhone 15 / 15 Plus / 15 Pro / 15 Pro Max

HoloKit's support starts from the iPhone XS and onwards. This is due to the high computational requirements of AR applications which earlier iPhone models may not efficiently handle.

Please note that HoloKit does not support iPhone Mini and iPhone SE models. The smaller screen sizes of these models limit their ability to effectively render stereo images.
