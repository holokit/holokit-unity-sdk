# Supported Android Devices

The following Android models are supported by HoloKit:

- Samsung
  - Samsung Galaxy S21
 
If your Android phone is not supported, we also provide a calibration method to let you figure out the specs of your Android phone yourself. You can then enter your Android phone specs to the SDK to have your device rendering stereo images. Please see [Phone Calibration Guide](Phone_Calibration_Guide.md), which is a step-by-step guide on how to figure out the specs of your phone model.
